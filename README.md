# *Taranos Pseudo-API*

### What is Taranos Pseudo-API?
This is a high-level Python "pseudo-API" for the canonical web APIs of [_Taranos:CSF_](https://github.com/taranos/taranoscsf).  It is intended for educational and tooling purposes and expects to communicate with the [*Taranos Reference Server*](https://github.com/taranos/taranoscsf-refserver) or an API-compatible server to function.

### Getting Started

Step 1:  Clone the Python package and use as needed:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/taranos/taranoscsf-papi.git
```
Step 2:  Ensure the PYTHONPATH environment variable includes the path to the `taranoscsfpapi` package.
